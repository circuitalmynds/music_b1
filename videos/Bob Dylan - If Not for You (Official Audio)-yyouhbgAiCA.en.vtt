00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.326
If not for you

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:30.663
Babe, I couldn't find the door

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.000
Couldn't even see the floor

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.103
I'd be sad and blue

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.906
If not for you

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.813
If not for you

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.384
Babe, I'd lay awake all night

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.721
Wait for the mornin' light

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.624
To shine in through

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.227
But it would not be new

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.997
If not for you

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.238
If not for you

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:16.176
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.447
Without your love
I'd be nowhere at all

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:24.818
I'd be lost if not for you
And you know it's true

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.134
If not for you

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:45.472
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:49.409
Without your love
I'd be nowhere at all

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.413
Oh! What would I do
If not for you

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.095
If not for you

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:13.600
Winter would have no spring

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.936
Couldn't hear the robin sing

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.039
I just wouldn't have a clue

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.276
Anyway it wouldn't ring true

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:37.557
If not for you
