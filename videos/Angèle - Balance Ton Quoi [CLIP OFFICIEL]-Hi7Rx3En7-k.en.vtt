00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
They all talk like animals

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.860
Bad-mouth every pussy

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.160
It's 2018 I don't know what you're thinking

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.440
But I am more than just an animal

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.700
I see that rap is all the rage

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.000
The dirtier it is the more success it has

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.260
Hey it's time we break the codes

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.580
A girl should speak her mind

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.280
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.900
Even if you talk badly about girls I know that deep down you understand

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.880
“Balance Ton Quoi”, one day maybe things will change

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.760
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.980
So let me sing to you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.480
Go f*** yourself...

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.440
I won't be on the radio

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.780
'Cause my words are not so nice

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.760
People say between the lines

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.820
For a pretty girl you're not so stupid

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.840
For a funny girl you're not so ugly

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.140
Your parents and your brother helped

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.800
Oh, you're talking about me

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.580
What's your problem?

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.340
I wrote a beautiful poem just for you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.880
Let me sing to you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.320
Go f*** yourself...

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.560
I'll be polite for the tv

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.980
Go f*** yourself...

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.380
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.120
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.880
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.300
One day maybe things will change

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.520
There's no respect now in the street

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.560
Boy, you know when you're out of line

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.640
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.020
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.920
Has everyone understood ?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.280
Sorry, I just want to go back to a point that's not...very clear

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.720
it's just that when a girl says no, I get the impression that it often means it's...

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.480
It's no.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.720
No.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.880
Ok. Right...

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.020
Not that simple, you really have to get it.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.480
What I understood is that...

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.020
Sorry, I have to interrupt you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.600
It's just that I have a second point, when a girl is sleeping, you don't know if you can, if you can't...

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.920
So I think that maybe if in doubt, you can try...

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.720
No no, let her sleep. If she's asleep, you let her sleep.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.200
Yes. Yes of course.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.900
And not think we can impose our desire, you said.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.980
Yes, very good Tobias. No need to shout, but that's great.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.780
No need to shout because as we're all here, we can hear just fine.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.720
Always a remark...

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.000
Is there a problem?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.400
No just saying you're always making remarks...

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.900
And?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.820
It would be better if you tried to understand women, listen to them...

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.420
I don't listen to women? I don't listen to women?

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.920
That's what it seems

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.820
Wait, we can see that you're being so insensitive here

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.760
Guys, calm down, I think that what you're trying...

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.340
Hey hey, quiet, shut up! Why?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.860
I don't know

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.400
She butts in... all hysterical. It's crazy

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.820
Very unpleasant

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.360
We were talking about desire!

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.840
This is stupid, why are we arguing. She's the one interrupting...

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.620
Busybody!

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.800
Let me sing to you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.100
Go f*** yourself...

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.980
I won't be on the radio

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.580
'Cause my words are not so nice

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.160
Let me sing to you

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.720
Go f*** yourself...

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.900
I'll be polite for the tv

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.580
Go f*** yourself...

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.560
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.500
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.520
“Balance Ton Quoi”

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.520
Even if you talk badly about girls I know that deep down you understand

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.700
“Balance ton quoi”, one day maybe things will change

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.220
“Balance ton quoi”

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.080
And what you have to understand is that when a girl says no... We can believe that.... And actually it's no.
