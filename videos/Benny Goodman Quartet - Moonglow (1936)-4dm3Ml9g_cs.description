Having hit #1 with "Moonglow" in 1934 with an earlier recording featuring his full orchestra, Goodman decided to record the song again for a different version featuring his quartet. This version charted at #8 in 1936. The musicians here are Goodman,  Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson and Gene Krupa. Recorded August 21, 1936 (Victor 25398). "Moonglow" has enjoyed enduring popularity both by itself and when combined with the theme from "Picnic" (as it frequently was following the release of the 1956 movie "Picnic" in which the songs were fused together seamlessly).

B-side is "Dinah".
